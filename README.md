# New York Housing EDA Project

## Project Overview
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the New York housing dataset. The main goal is to extract insights and identify trends in housing prices, neighborhood statistics, and various factors that influence the housing market in New York. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to uncover patterns that can inform decisions in real estate and urban planning.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains data on housing prices and features in New York, including:
- Property types (e.g., apartment, house)
- Prices
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Square footage
- Year built
- Neighborhood location

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, inconsistent data types, and outliers in the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
  - Univariate and bivariate analysis to understand distributions and relationships.
  - Visualization of trends using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features such as price per square foot.
- **Geographical Analysis:** Examined housing prices across different neighborhoods.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Investigated relationships between housing prices and other factors like neighborhood, year built, etc.

## Usage
The Newyork_housing.ipynb notebook provides step-by-step code and analysis for the project. The notebook covers:

1.Data cleaning and preprocessing.
2.Visualizations for understanding the data.
3.Statistical analysis and insights drawn from the dataset.
4.Simply run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the EDA and visualize the results.
